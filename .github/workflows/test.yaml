# This workflow is used to deploy Maven snapshot artifacts to GitHub packages or Maven Central repository.
# It is triggered on pushes to branches other than main and release branches.
# The workflow uses the `netcracker/qubership-workflow-hub/actions/maven-snapshot-deploy` action to perform the deployment.
# Please read the documentation on how to configure pom.xml for the deployment to work properly:
# https://github.com/netcracker/qubership-workflow-hub/blob/main/docs/maven-publish-pom-preparation_doc.md
